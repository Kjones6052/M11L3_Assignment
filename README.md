# **Hello, World!**

The files in this repository are for my assignment React Component Lifecycle, Events, and Forms Assignment, Module 11 Lesson 3.


Overview:

For this assignment, I crafted 2 functional components; 1 gets basic info about a list of Marvel Comic Characters for display, and 1 gets 
additional details about a specific character to display additional info to the user. I also implemented an event handler to display the 
additional information when a user clicks on the image of a character.
