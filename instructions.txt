React Component Lifecycle, Events, and Forms Assignment, Module 11 Lesson 3


Part 1: 
Mastering React Functional Components and Axios with useEffect

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to develop proficiency in using React functional components, managing side effects with the 'useEffect' hook, and performing HTTP 
requests using Axios. This hands-on exercise will enhance your skills in building dynamic, data-driven React applications.

Problem Statement:
Your task is to create a React application that interacts with the Marvel Comics API. The application should handle asynchronous operations such as fetching data, 
processing requests, and updating the user interface dynamically using modern JavaScript features.

Task 1: Sign Up for API Key:
 - Go to the Marvel Developer website and sign up for an API key. 
 - Use hash generator for MD5 hash to be used with the API keys.
status: COMPLETE

Task 2: Fetch and Display Characters
 - Create a functional component 'CharacterList' to display a list of Marvel Comics Characters.
 - Use 'useEffect' hook to fetch character data from the Marvel Comics API using Axios.
 - Display each character's name and thumbnail image in a grid format.
status: incomplete

Task 3: Implement the Character Detail Feature
 - Create a functional component 'CharacterDetail' to display the detailed information about a selected character.
 - Implement a click event handler to fetch additional character details asynchronously when a character thumbnail is clicked.
 - Use Axios to send a GET request to the Marvel Comics API.
 - Display the character's name, description, and a list of associated comics.
status: incomplete

Task 4: Integrating Components and Updating the User interface
 - In the main 'App' component, integrate 'CharacterList' and 'CharacterDetail'.
 - Ensure that the character detail view updates dynamically when a character thumbnail is clicked.
